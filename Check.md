The error message you provided, "System.InvalidOperationException: A second operation was started on this context instance before a previous operation completed," indicates that you are trying to perform multiple database operations on the same instance of the DbContext simultaneously, which is not allowed in Entity Framework Core. Entity Framework Core does not support parallel operations on the same DbContext instance by design.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that you are not attempting to use the same DbContext instance concurrently from multiple threads or methods. Each operation that interacts with the database should create its own separate DbContext instance.

Here are some common approaches to avoid this error:

1. **Use a Scoped DbContext:** In ASP.NET Core applications, it's common to use dependency injection to manage the DbContext's scope. You can configure your DbContext to be scoped, meaning that a new instance is created for each HTTP request. This ensures that each HTTP request operates on its own DbContext.

    ```csharp
    services.AddDbContext<YourDbContext>(options =>
    {
        options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("YourConnectionString"));
    }, ServiceLifetime.Scoped);
    ```

2. **Create a New DbContext Instance:** Ensure that you create a new DbContext instance within each method or operation that interacts with the database.

    ```csharp
    using (var context = new YourDbContext())
    {
        // Perform database operations using 'context'
    }
    ```

3. **Use Asynchronous Operations:** If you are using asynchronous database operations, make sure that you are awaiting each operation before starting the next one. This helps prevent concurrent access issues.

    ```csharp
    using (var context = new YourDbContext())
    {
        // Await the asynchronous database operations
        await context.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
    ```

By following these practices, you can avoid concurrent access issues with Entity Framework Core's DbContext. If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about your code and how DbContext is being used, and I can provide further assistance.
